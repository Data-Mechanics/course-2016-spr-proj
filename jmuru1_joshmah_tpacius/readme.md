#CS591L1: Data Mechanics Project Two

#Introduction
In this project, we sought to test hypotheses about relationships between hospitals, traffic jams, and property values. More specifically, we wanted to determine:
	<ol>
	 <li> if traffic jams were more likely in zip codes with lower property values and <li><li> if there are more hospitals in areas with higher property values <li>
	</ol>

#Narrative and Justification
To test these hypotheses, we reduced several datasets relating to local hospitals, traffic delay, and property value assessments. We focused on finding streets prone to traffic delay that hospitals were on, the number of hospitals in particular zip codes, and the average property values in different zip codes. More specifically, we made reductions on: 
	<ol>
	<li> Waze Street Jam data and Boston Hospital locations using street intersections as an operator to determine how frequently traffic jams occurred on streets hospitals were located on in a window of time between February 2015 and March 2015. <li><li> Property Assessments data and Hospital locations using zip codes as an operator to determine how many hospitals are each each zip code <li><li> Property Assessments data and Hospital locations using zip codes as an operator to determine the average property value of each Boston zip code <li>
	</ol>
With these reductions, we believe that we should be able to determine if relationships between hospital locations and traffic patterns as well as hospital locations and hospital location and property values are both present and significant.
