### Background

> Since former Mayor Menino launched Boston Bikes **(http://www.bostonbikes.org/)** in 2007, ridership in the City has more than doubled. Many other important strides have been made in safety, education, and facilities.

> Boston Bikes is putting together a broad picture of cycling in Boston by analyzing data from a variety of sources. The Boston Public Health Commission is analyzing crash data from Boston Emergency Medical Services, Boston Police Department and local emergency departments. Further, Boston Bikes confirmed ridership using information compiled by the League of American Bicyclists. Boston Bikes conducted multiple surveys with over 4,000 respondents. Key findings can soon be found here once fully analyzed. Boston Bikes will continue to seek public input in the upcoming year to improve bike safety, education, and ridership.

> Additionally, Boston Bikes conducted its annual traffic counts at 24 different locations. Together, these sources of data provide a broad picture of cycling in Boston. Boston Bikes will continue seek public input in the upcoming year to improve bike safety, education, and ridership.
