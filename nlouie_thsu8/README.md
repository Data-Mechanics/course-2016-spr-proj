### Running the package


### Functionality

> Write a short narrative and justification (at least 7-10 sentences) explaining how the data sets and techniques you hope to employ can address the problem you chose. Depending on what techniques you are using and what problem you are trying to solve, you may need to provide a justification or evaluation methodology for the techniques you are using (i.e., why you believe the chosen techniques will solve the problem you are trying to address). Include this narrative in the README.md file within your directory (you may only need to update your existing file).
